# ovhmi

The HMI/SCADA local application transfer project of the non-nuclear thermal power plant training simulator to the Web environment.

Applications are developed, that simulate the functions of preparing and displaying SCADA Ovation, video frames in the Web browser.

Was used the [`ANTLR+Java tool`](https://github.com/sergoleg/ovgl2js) to develop the Ovation text file translator in JavaScript language programs and 2D WebGL visualization technology (Pixi JS).

Some applications are designed in the form of Docker images (Linux, Windows, translator, proxy service for WebSocket, Perl, Python, C/C++ ...).

Initially, ActionScript were used in similar projects (until 2011), then the Raphael JS JavaScript framework (SVG, until 2019). 

Simulation of the Ovation (Westinghouse, Emerson) human-machine interface (JavaScript, Pixi.js).
